# configurable-api

Write the config to call the api via component or javascript function.

Back in early 2019, while having brainstorming session with my team, I had an idea about making the api as configurable and only implement the changes for different requirement in config file.

## How to use

Run the command below in your project:

- `npm install configurable-api`

You can now import `configurable-api` as a normal package installed from npm like so:

```
import ConfigurableApi from 'configurable-api'

...
<ConfigurableApi />
...
```

## Available props

```

```
